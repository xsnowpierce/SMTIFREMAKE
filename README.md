In order to access a level you must type in the console: "level school"
Other console commands are:
- "enterbattle" to start a pre determined battle
- "loadscene worldmap" to enter the world map

OLD TUTORIAL PAGE:
Once the game opens up, you will be in a void. This is normal.
In order to leave the void, you will have to input console commands.

In order to open the console:
- Press the `/~ key, which is to the left of the key for 1.

Here you will have access to a variety of commands, described lower.
The command to enter the school area is "level school", type that without the quotes and press enter,
   and then the `/~ key once again to close the console.

NOTE: It is recommended you use the "performance" command in the console to monitor your performance, at least the first time
   So I can figure out how well it's running on specs similar to yours.

Here you can walk around, talk to NPCs in classrooms, and that's pretty much it. I think there might be some 
   rooms that will soft lock you on entering, such as the doors at the ends of the hallways on 2F and 3F.

Once you have had your fill there, you may either load the World Map scene, or enter a battle. 
   (Entering battle will softlock you once it's over)

In order to open the world map:
- Open the console and type "loadscene worldmap" without the quotations and press enter.

In order to enter battle:
- Open the console and type "enterbattle" without the quotations and press enter.

Once you have done all of this, you have seen pretty much all there is to see so far. As progress is made on the game, more updates
   will be pushed to steam, in which you can test further. Thank you!!

Other console commands that might be useful:
"performance": Opens a graph of FPS, ram, specs, etc that would help see how well the game runs on your hardware.
"clear": Clears the console output
